blurb: Wren is the littlest Calcote, she is six years old and is in first grade. Wren has collected more nicknames in her six years of life than anyone should be allowed to collect. She began telling people her name was Pie when she was three and it’s just evolved from there. If you forget her name feel free to make up a new one, she probably won’t even notice. Wren is always in search of someone new to meet, a joke to tell, a canvas to paint, or an animal to sneak into bed with her. Wren was born with big ideas and she usually finds a way to turn those ideas into something great.
