blurb: West is the middle little, he’s in third grade and eight years old. West rarely finds himself in a situation that can’t be improved upon with a glue gun and/or a bit of tape (ok, a lot of tape). Our  master crafter is well-known for raiding the recycling bin in search of supplies. He’s built his own backyard fort, complete with zip line and is no doubt a future engineer. West would keep snails for pets if his mom would let him. He enjoys snacking on anything sweet, and is expected to reach an impressive 6 feet 8 inches one day (Lord, help us, please).
