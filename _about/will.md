blurb: Will is the eldest of the three children. As a ten year old fifth grader, some of Will’s favorite things include math, science, and video games. Will is an amazing lawn mower, he can bottle feed three spring fawn at one time, and he is training to be the next American Ninja. Will is the quietest of the three Calcote children but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a million things going on behind his big green eyes. Will is at the top of his class academically and absorbs new information like a sponge.
