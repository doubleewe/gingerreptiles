blurb: Jill is currently blessed to be a stay-at-home mom, but has a professional background in Senior Care and Event Planning. Her hobbies include volunteering, rescuing and rehabilitating local wildlife, and anything and everything that lets her flex her creative muscles. She bakes, builds, paints, sews, and crafts; and she encourages everyone around her to do the same. Jill believes most people, especially women, have an innate desire to create. Jill has her hands full with three kids, pets, rescues, and arts supplies, just the way she likes it!
